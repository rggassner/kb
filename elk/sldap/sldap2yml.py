def parse_ldap_entries_and_extract_attributes(ldap_entries, attributes_to_extract):
    """
    Parses LDAP entries obtained directly from an LDAP server and extracts specified attributes.

    It iterates through the LDAP entries (which are tuples of DN and attribute dictionary),
    collects all attributes for each user (identified by 'uid'), and then organizes this data
    by the specified attributes. If an attribute is missing for a user, an empty string
    is used as its value in the output.

    Args:
        ldap_entries (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple is (dn, attributes_dict).
                             attributes_dict contains byte string values.
        attributes_to_extract (list): A list of attribute names (strings) to extract.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are the requested attribute names and values are
              dictionaries. Each inner dictionary maps a 'uid' (from the LDAP server)
              to its corresponding extracted attribute value. If an attribute is not
              present for a user, its value will be an empty string.
